👋 Hi there, it's @MrMarcoMarino

I'm a 28 years old smart contract developer from germany. On my github i will present you my latest work and projects.

👀 Biography: 
I started programming in c++ in 2008. I remember my first project was a chat application like ICQ. Years later I decided to learn more about game development and started my first projects in Unreal Engine 4. Unfortunately I never finished these projects because of the massive content and design part needed for good game in these days. However, I learned a lot. There were three projects I worked on for several years: The first one is a simple jump and run mobile game. In my second project I learned virtual reality development in UE4. The third and biggest game project I ever started was a game i wanted to call "Minimal Wars". It's an multiplayer based team combat game where players are starting in a big labyrinth, farming weapons, skills and armor and then fight for the last team standing. During this time I learned a lot and improved my workflow and learning process as a flexible coder. As a sole programmer without a team, I had to learn every area of game development to advance my project. Be it level creation, integration of a multiplayer combat system, materialisation, creation and integration of animations in state machines, mesh modelling, etc.
Since 5 years I am the marketing manager of QASS GmbH in Germany, responsible for the external image, strategic planning, team coordination, the website, creative content and our brand presence.
