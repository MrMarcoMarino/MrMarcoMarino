👋 Hi there, it's @MrMarcoMarino

I'm a 28 years old smart contract developer from germany. On my github i will present you my latest work and projects.

👀 Biography: I started programming in c++ in 2008. I remember my first project was a chat application like ICQ. Years later I decided to learn more about game development and started my first projects in Unreal Engine 4. Unfortunately I never finished these projects because of the massive content and design part needed for good game in these days. However, I learned a lot. There were three projects I worked on for several years: The first one is a simple jump and run mobile game. In my second project I learned virtual reality development in UE4. The third and biggest game project I ever started was a game i wanted to call "Minimal Wars". It's an multiplayer based team combat game where players are starting in a big labyrinth, farming weapons, skills and armor and then fight for the last team standing. First I coded my own combat symstem, then I learned GAS (Gameplay Ability System). 

🌱 Programming languages: Solidity, Python, C++, Reactjs, JavaScript, Swift, HTML, (Brownie / Truffle)
 
💞️ Programms I learned: Unreal Engine 4/5, Adobe Photoshop / Premiere / After Effects, Keyshot, Wordpress, Cleverreach
